# MAGIS M heat pumps (Midea M-Thermal) – mt_ packages

**English** · [Polski](magis-m-midea.pl.md)

Back to the [protocol overview](../README.md).

> **Experimental – not tested on a MAGIS M yet.** The packages implement the Midea M-Thermal Modbus protocol the
> MAGIS M is built on. If you have one, please report what you see (see [Collecting logs](collecting-logs.md)).

The Immergas **MAGIS M** (M4 – M30, R32) is a Midea M-Thermal heat pump: wired controller with the H1 / H2 Modbus
port, the T1S / T4 / T5 / IBH / TBH names in the menu. It has nothing to do with the Samsung-based MAGIS PRO / COMBO V2
that the rest of this hub serves. The **MAGIS M TOP** (R290, E-BOX TOP) is different again: its BMS port speaks the
Immergas generator BMS protocol – the `gb_mtop` package, see [Gas boilers over Modbus BMS](gas-boiler-bms.md).

## Hardware

| Part | |
|---|---|
| [M5Stack AtomS3 Lite](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/AtomS3%20Lite) + ATOMIC PortABC | ESP32-S3; Port C (RX GPIO6, TX GPIO5) |
| 1× M5Stack Isolated RS485 Unit | galvanic isolation, automatic direction (no DE pin) |

Any ESP32 with an RS485 transceiver works (`mt_uart_rx_pin` / `mt_uart_tx_pin`).

## Wiring

| Hub (RS485) | Wired controller | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A / B | **H1 / H2** | sources disagree which is A+ – nothing answers: swap them; a 120 Ω resistor between H1 and H2 may be needed |
| GND | **E** | reference |
| – | ~~A / B~~ | **never**: 13.5 V AC supply of the controller |
| – | ~~X / Y~~ | **never**: internal controller ↔ hydro module bus |

The hub is the master, the controller the slave: **9600 baud, 8N1, address 1** (controller menu *FOR SERVICEMAN →
17 HMI ADDRESS*). Only one master on H1 / H2, and the controller has to stay connected – it serves the registers.

## Installation

> 📄 **Configuration file: [`examples/immergas-magis-m.yaml`](../examples/immergas-magis-m.yaml)**
> ([open on GitHub](https://github.com/jotuera/immergas-modbus-bms-nasa-opentherm-hub/blob/main/examples/immergas-magis-m.yaml) · [download (raw)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jotuera/immergas-modbus-bms-nasa-opentherm-hub/main/examples/immergas-magis-m.yaml))

1. **Copy the configuration.** Save [`immergas-magis-m.yaml`](../examples/immergas-magis-m.yaml) into your ESPHome folder (in Home Assistant:
   *ESPHome → New device → Continue → Skip*, then paste its content into the new file).
2. **Add the secrets** it uses to `secrets.yaml`: `wifi_ssid`, `wifi_password`, `immergas_magis_m_api_key`, `immergas_magis_m_ota_password`.
3. **Pick what you need** in the `packages:` block at the end of the file:

   ```yaml
   files:
     - packages/lang/mt_en.yaml        # or mt_pl.yaml
     - packages/mt_core.yaml
     - packages/mt_status.yaml
     - packages/mt_sensors.yaml
     - packages/mt_energy.yaml
     - packages/mt_control.yaml
     - packages/mt_params.yaml         # optional: installer parameters, read only
   ```

   - Start with all packages; leave out `mt_control` for a read-only first run.
   - `mt_energy_multiply` (substitution) if the energy counters come out 100× too small.
4. **Check the pins** (`substitutions:` at the top) if your board is not an AtomS3 + ATOMIC PortABC.
5. **Flash** the device (USB the first time, then over the air) and **add it in Home Assistant** (*Settings → Devices
   & services* – it is found automatically).
6. **Check the connection:** *Immergas M - Protocol version* and *Water outlet temperature* get values within a minute. Nothing = swap H1 / H2, check the 120 Ω resistor and the controller address (menu 17).

**Wait for the first readings before changing anything** – the on / off and function switches change single bits of
shared registers and use the last value read.

**Still to confirm on a MAGIS M:** the H1 / H2 polarity, the energy counter unit, the pressure scale of the protocol
version, whether the setpoints of register 2 follow the resolution flag, and the fault code numbering (shown as a
number). The installer parameters from 209 up are not written on purpose.

## Knowledge base

- The Midea M-Thermal Modbus protocol of the wired controller (KJR-120 family) – the register map above; the protocol
  version (187) and the resolution flag (189) tell which variant a unit has.
- MAGIS M installer manual ST006126a: controller terminals A B X Y E and H1 / H2 / E, menu *FOR SERVICEMAN → 17 HMI
  ADDRESS SET*, parameters T1S / T4 / T5 / IBH / TBH.
