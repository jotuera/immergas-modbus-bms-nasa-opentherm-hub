# FSV installer map — Immergas Magis Combo V2 + Samsung NASA

Back to the [protocol overview](../README.md) · [MAGIS PRO / COMBO V2](magis-pro-combo-v2.md).


Full map of **all 94 FSV installer settings** from the Samsung NASA bus (F1/F2) and their status **on this particular installation** (Magis Combo V2 Plus + Audax Pro, the loop is run by the Immergas controller). The project has been slimmed down: **only what actually works is exposed by default**; the rest is **commented out** in the packages (not deleted — kept with a description for reference/restoring). See also [ff-control-results.md](ff-control-results.md).

> **Why so much is disabled?** On the Magis it is **Immergas** that calculates the setpoint (`0x4247`) and runs the circuit, the pump and DHW; Samsung is blind to the DHW cylinder (`0x4237`=0) and to the pump (`0x4089`=OFF despite flow). Most FSVs are either **overridden**, or **inactive** (the component the function needs is missing), or concern **hardware not present** on this installation.

## Summary

- ✅ **Exposed and working: 9** — outing mode setpoints 5011–5019 (Configuration). Plus levers **outside FSV** in Control: outing mode `0x406D` and FR control `0x40A7`.

- → **Moved to Control: 1** (FR 5051).

- 🔇 **Disabled — no hardware: 17** (heaters, mixing valve, zones, thermostats).

- 🔇 **Disabled — inactive/overridden: 67** (curve, limits, DHW, modes requiring contacts).


**Total 94 FSV. Active entities: 9.**
